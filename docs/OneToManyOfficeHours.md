# One-to-Many Office Hours

Thank you for your interest in the FastTrack for Azure ISV and Startups One-to-Many Sessions!

To help support our ISV and Startup customers that are engaged through FastTrack for Azure,
Microsoft for Startups, and other managed offerings, we have regularly scheduled Office Hours.
These meetings are specifically for questions around the published One-to-Many videos, and are
**not** general support sessions.

Below are the currently scheduled upcoming Office Hours meetings:
